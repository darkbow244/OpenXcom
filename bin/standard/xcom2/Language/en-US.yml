  STR_SONIC_OSCILLATOR_UFOPEDIA: "A POWERFUL AUDITORY OSCILLATOR CREATES WAVES OF SONIC FORCE.  DESTROYING THE TARGET BY VIBRATING ITS MOLECULAR BONDS APART."
  STR_AQUATOID_UFOPEDIA: "The Aquatoid Race is an ancient society, having existed millennia before man's first faltering steps upon the world.  Their compact form and bulbous features are a throwback to their space faring brethren, the Sectoids.  Their power is based on the powerful Molecular Control technology.  The Aquatoid race seeks to propagate its sterile race by genetic modification, the ideal subjects being human beings.  Experiments have spawned numerous hybrid races."
  STR_AQUATOID_AUTOPSY: "Aquatoid autopsy"
  STR_AQUATOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A detailed analysis of this creature allows us to make some basic assumptions.  It is a Sectoid, our former foes, but changed by surgical methods and implants to be an aquatic creature.  Vestigial lungs allow the breathing of air and limited surface mobility.  There are cybernetic implants throughout the body, enhancing the strength of its atrophied limbs and the function of its organs.  As all the members of this race are identical, we may hypothesize that these creatures are clones."
  STR_GILLMAN_UFOPEDIA: "Almost human, a strange creature who appears to be a reptilian humanoid, very closely related to man.  This creature is extremely powerful and fast in the undersea world.  Gillmen are a fully fledged race, there being male and female specimens of varying ages.  They are unlike the majority of the underwater aliens as they bear none of the signs of genetic alteration or surgical deformation  It is possible we are looking at some ancient branch of our own species."
  STR_GILLMAN_AUTOPSY: "Gillman autopsy"
  STR_GILLMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once surgery began it became clear this is no alien, but an Earth born creature, an ancient pre-historic race that was thought destroyed at the very moment mammals became dominant.  In a time when dinosaurs roamed these creatures lived, the Gillmen- amphibious, intelligent and strong. The cataclysm that ended the reptile rule on this planet forced these creatures into a symbiotic relationship with the newly arrived aliens.  A small electronic device is lodged in the skulls of the creatures."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_UFOPEDIA: "This is a staggering creature, taller than a man and boasting six limbs, it resembles nothing more than an aquatic Demon.  The similarities between this creature and the Earth lobster have earned it the nickname of Lobsterman with the X-Com troops.  This is a behemoth of the deep.  A carefully designed fighting creature of incredible strength and practically invulnerable to missile fire.  Its pincers alone can crush steel."
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_AUTOPSY: "Lobsterman autopsy"
  STR_LOBSTERMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once past its virtually indestructible shell the creature is an amazing construction.  Powerful muscles ripple around a titanium skeleton, a sophisticated targeting system with multi-band scanning ability is hooked directly into the creature's brain.  Its multiple eyes are protected by harder than steel plastics and it is clear that when well deployed by their masters these creatures are all but unstoppable.  Buried deep within its body are devices of unknown construction and function."
  STR_TASOTH_UFOPEDIA: "These agile and fast enemies are a mainstay of the alien army.  Hundreds are birthed, in massive breeding vats deep in the heart of the Alien colonies. Vastly more powerful than a man, the Tasoth is a true alien and its behavior and carnivorous nature unmatched on the planet. The Tasoth often forms the spearhead of an alien attack and never seems to shrink from the fight even in the face of overwhelming odds."
  STR_TASOTH_AUTOPSY: "Tasoth autopsy"
  STR_TASOTH_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Dissection revealed a cybernetic organism possessed of strange power. Inside the body cavity is a small power unit, but no identifiable organs. The power is transmitted throughout the body by a Bio-electric transmission system. The whole body lacks bones or any other supporting structure. Once dead the power stops and the creature becomes a lifeless rag doll of oozing alien flesh and fluids. The only other internal construction is a pair of ceramic cells, which if energized briefly revive the creature."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_UFOPEDIA: "The Deep One is a biological nightmare, a cross breed, produced by the mind warping experiments of the Aquatoids.  We have encountered several variations of this creature. After extensive research we conclude that these are manufactured by the invaders.  Swelling their ranks when fresh human stock has been captured. Each of these sub-humans is armed with an electrical energy discharge powerful enough to kill an aquanaut."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_AUTOPSY: "Deep One autopsy"
  STR_DEEP_ONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The creature is a graft of man and alien organism.  The human brain is massively altered to accommodate control electronics and the Alien cortex.  All vestiges of the human body seem lost save one: the eyes.  The surgical graft appears to allow the alien foetus to consume the human host as it grows.  The tough skin of the creature appears to be a non-organic, metallic mesh, extremely strong and flexible.  The resulting cross breed is strong, fast and utterly under the control of the aliens."
  STR_BIO_DRONE_UFOPEDIA: "The Bio-drone is a creation only an alien mind could conceive of. It is a brain, (human or alien) suspended in amniotic fluids and connected to a powered base unit that can fly on land or below water.  Each Bio-drone is armed with a powerful auditory disruptor, part machine and part organism.  Some of our scientists have suggested that the weapon is driven by the host organisms original vocal cords.  Highly accurate and tenacious these super guard dogs are widely used by the aliens to protect valuable assets."
  STR_BIO_DRONE_AUTOPSY: "Bio-drone autopsy"
  STR_BIO_DRONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The hypothesis that the auditory disruptor is a biological device are true.  This unfortunate creature literally screams its enemies to death.  Every example has massive surgical trauma scars and is severely mutilated. The aliens appear to butcher the brain into obedience.  Most of the cortex's used in the creatures are alien in origin, but nothing can compare to the horror of finding a human based unit.The Bio-drones are powered by an ION engine and incorporate some form of remote control system."
  STR_TENTACULAT_UFOPEDIA: "Not even the depths of a Lovecraftian nightmare could spawn such as this indescribable creature.  No comparison to any Earth animal exists, the environment that could produce such as this is beyond imagination.  Armed with long tentacles the Tentaculat paralyzes its victims then transmutes them into mindless things.  These progeny can cause death on touch, even through armor.  The Tentaculat is the most fearsome alien yet encountered by X-Com."
  STR_TENTACULAT_AUTOPSY: "Tentaculat autopsy"
  STR_TENTACULAT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The autopsy reveals small cybernetic implants are lodged in the creature's large brain. The vision system is a complex combination of visible light and thermal imaging acquisition.  Even in the inky depths of the ocean this monster can navigate with unerring accuracy.  There are vestigial organs that seem to be the bare minimum for survival.  Each creature has a small stomach with an external connector, it is logical to assume the being is fed by direct nutrient input by its masters."
  STR_CALCINITE_UFOPEDIA: "Like the diving suits of lost mariners these aliens stalk the seabed for the unwary.  A vicious swipe by the creature's stronger than steel claws can be enough to send the best divers to the bottom.  Swirling around in the face mask a gelatinous green form can be seen.  No hint of the real creature can be divined from the often lethal encounters we have had with them."
  STR_CALCINITE_AUTOPSY: "Calcinite autopsy"
  STR_CALCINITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once the armored suit is stripped away the Calcinite is revealed to be a huge amorphous blob of protoplasm.  No visible brain, limbs or sensory organs exist, a small metallic component resides deep in the liquid body.  Once dead we can only guess at the creature's nature.  An inexplicable enigma of our alien enemies."
  STR_TRISCENE_UFOPEDIA: "This bipedal reptile is a throwback to the age of the Dinosaurs. It seems to be a Cretaceous creature in every sense save its ability to survive in water and on land.  These creatures are slung with weapons pods and have a jaw lined with huge metallic teeth.  Often these monsters have been at the core of the alien attack forces as the Aliens launch assaults upon the land.  A heavyweight and potent weapon, the Lobster men commanders deploy them with lethal efficiency."
  STR_TRISCENE_AUTOPSY: "Triscene autopsy"
  STR_TRISCENE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Once subjected to the scientist's knife the Triscene reveals that it is an ancient creature, supplemented with cybernetic implants and weapons systems.  Its tiny brain is supplemented by a small computer module mounted in the control harness all the creatures wear. A tough natural skin, a predatory instinct enhanced by additional weapons makes this a lethal opponent in all environments."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_UFOPEDIA: "Having harvested the oceans the aliens have bred these huge Earth creatures as a weapon.  Do not be lulled into a false sense of security when facing these harmless looking sailors of the deeps.  Possessed of a formidable, ranged, freezing blast and a close combat icy strike, the Hallucinoid is a deadly foe."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_AUTOPSY: "Hallucinoid autopsy"
  STR_HALLUCINOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Nested in the many layers of the gelatinous body of this organism is a powerful chemical freezer, its' main offensive capability.  The soft and supple skin of the Hallucinoid seems susceptible to heat based attacks.  Often this mutant is found in the company of its masters, the Aquatoids."
  STR_XARQUID_UFOPEDIA: "Another modified Earth invertebrate, the Xarquid is a creature of great beauty and danger.  The swift swimming gargantuan hides a devastating arsenal of weapons, a smothering ink spray and an ionized particle blast.  Since our first encounters with this powerful creature we have been wary of its power and its controllers the vengeful Gillmen."
  STR_XARQUID_AUTOPSY: "Xarquid autopsy"
  STR_XARQUID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This overgrown Nautilus has been made huge on a diet of Alien drugs and surgical alterations.  Perverted beyond the scope of nature, the Gillmen have added mechanical control systems to the creature and now none of the creature's original nature exists.  Deployed as an organic weapons platform, the Xarquids tough shell and mobility make it a formidable opponent."
  STR_ION_BEAM_ACCELERATORS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien flying submarines rely on complex power systems to drive them at incredible speed through the deeps.  The basis for their technology is the ION DISPLACER, utilizing Zrbite as a catalyst, the engines displace 100 times their own volume in water per second.  This enormous power means that the aliens' are capable of outrunning most Earth subs.  We can replicate this system of propulsion using aqua-plastics and Zrbite power cells."
  STR_MAGNETIC_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "These units generate a spherical multi-layer magnetic field, which the array projects up to 1000m around the sub.  The Alien navigators are directly linked into the machines and feel their way around the invisible world beneath the waves. The interface system operates using Alien modified cerebral matter that communicates directly with the operator's brain via a neural link."
  STR_ALIEN_SUB_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Each vessel has a chameleon-like structure, carefully modelled on sea creatures, and constructed of Aqua Plastics.  Each submarine functions as an organism: crew and craft in harmony.  Most of these systems can be replicated and a hybrid technology can be evolved to allow us to move up to the same technological level."
  STR_ALIEN_CRYOGENICS_UFOPEDIA: "The innumerable Aliens that have lain hidden on the Earth are held in suspended animation, cryogenically frozen.  All the creatures are sealed into units, their body temperature reduced to a point where bodily functions are all but stopped.  An examination of the units so far reveals the unbelievable time periods that the bodies have been kept suspended for, some over 60 million years."
  STR_ALIEN_CLONING_UFOPEDIA: "Many of the Aliens we have captured are identical even down to their DNA, duplicates in every way. Cell samples are placed into the units from the frozen gene banks of the Aliens.  Some units contain humans or body parts. It is possible that another use for these cloning units is to create some Alien-human hybrid."
  STR_ALIEN_LEARNING_ARRAYS_UFOPEDIA: "Utilizing Molecular Control Implants in the skulls of all Aliens these machines inject information directly into the brain.  Freshly cloned Aliens are brought to these units and have racial memories and all scientific or combat information downloaded into their blank minds."
  STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTER_UFOPEDIA: "This unit is used to fit Aliens with Molecular Control Implants, fertilize reproducing races, and insert or remove organs and electronics from any creature.  The process was thought to be done on subdued patients, but the subject is very aware of the process and unfortunately human anatomy seems to fit the unit perfectly."
  STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "We now have the evidence to work out why Aliens capture humans.  They are not food, they are not fertilized with Alien embryos, rather they form the basis of a range of creatures and control systems.  Alien technology is based on a common mind, a shared intellect and the human brain is the ideal receptacle for these systems.  Human brain tissue is used in most of the Alien biological computer storage and retrieval systems, the remains are used for building and for breeding."
  STR_AQUA_PLASTICS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien submarines and structures utilize an incredibly strong, flexible and durable material for the majority of their construction.  Aqua plastics are complex multi-bonded and Zrbite catalyzed materials. Dense, yet light, the substance has strength above even Titanium or Kevlar."
  STR_ZRBITE_UFOPEDIA: "This is an alloy of Alien origin, part gold part Alien Bio-material.  When utilized as a power source, small quantities will generate more power than a nuclear unit of 10 times the size.  It is beyond our technical ability to replicate this material as most of its constituents are Alien in origin."
  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "The Aliens strike all across the globe, with ruthless efficiency.  We cannot pin down their source.  Could it be in some ocean deep too impenetrable for us to locate?  Not all the organisms we have encountered are Alien, some are very old, some are from evolutionary paths long thought extinct.  We are dealing with a menace that has been sleeping for millennia, a subtle symbiosis of human and Alien.  Deep in the oceans there lie ancient sites used by the Aliens to contact their stellar cousins.  Each of these twelve sites contains a Synomium device, a powerful Alien technology. Now with their war machine on the march the Aliens are re-activating these sites to widen their Molecular Control net, we must destroy these sites at all costs."
  STR_THE_ULTIMATE_THREAT_UFOPEDIA: "Sixty five million years ago a vast colony ship was sent to the Earth from a distant Alien world.  As the enormous craft approached the infant planet a massive and violent solar flare caused a navigation systems failure. Crippled and failing the vast bulk plummeted through the stratosphere to emerge into Cretaceous  skies.  On the Earth innumerable species of life strained their gazes skywards as their nemesis ploughed into the planet. A vast cloud of dust clogged the atmosphere and as the land cooled so the dominant life, the mighty dinosaurs, perished.  But the 400 billion tonnes of  T'leth was not destroyed in the impact, sophisticated super computers initiated a cryogenic sleep cycle for the creatures deep in its holds.   As the aeons passed the computers woke parties of  Aliens to attempt communication with their stellar cousins, all in vain for the core of the Alien power slept on."
  STR_TLETH_THE_ALIEN_CITY: "T'leth the Alien's City"
  STR_TLETH_THE_ALIEN_CITY_UFOPEDIA: "T'leth the huge Alien colony ship lies embedded in the Sigsbee Deep, in the Gulf of Mexico.   At the Heart of the city is an Alien horror, so vile and so powerful that not even death can claim it.  In a chamber of Alien metal lies the sleeping form of the great dreamer, the Ultimate Alien.  Raising T'leth above the waves will begin his re-animation cycle, and once risen he will be unstoppable.  Although not alive and some how not dead the Alien mind controls the Alien army.  The weird technology of molecular control connects all Aliens to the One mind and the One mind to all the Aliens.  Genetically mutated Alien/human foetuses supply the Alien mind with energy and form the link between the ruler and his subjects.  The myth of the Ultimate Alien has existed in the hearts and minds of humankind for centuries, the sea has always hidden the ultimate truth."

  STR_VICTORY_1: "As you enter the chamber you see the alien brain - the object of your quest.  Before you can fire it communicates to you via a screen at its base.  It implores you to listen to its arguments for survival before you make the decision to pull the trigger..."
  STR_VICTORY_2: "The brain speaks: 'Many millions of years ago the planet you call Mars was alive.  This life was brought to a barren planet by our civilisation as it was to yours.  For millions of years we have visited your planet and genetically developed your species.  You cannot kill us, you are part of us..."

  STR_GAME_OVER_1: "The Alien forces over run the land. Once the Ultimate Alien has been revived they flood the world by melting the ice caps.  The huge Alien ship, T'leth, rises from the ocean and sears the remaining cities to rubble. The atmosphere becomes clogged with the dust of the carnage and the world begins to warm.  The remaining humans are rounded up and utilized to produce breeding stock for a new Alien world. We can offer no resistance to the new world order."

If a corporation or government co-operates with the invaders then its funding ceases."
  STR_ALIEN_COLONY_EXPANSION_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens will construct secret undersea colonies in remote locations. After some initial reconnaissance flights some intense Alien Sub activity will occur as the colony is being built.  These colonies are known to contain labs, cloning centres, surgical facilities for human and Alien experimentation.  The presence of Alien colonies will generate more Alien activity without the presence of Alien Subs.  In order to locate a colony an X-Com sub must patrol an area for a few hours to stand some chance of successful detection."
