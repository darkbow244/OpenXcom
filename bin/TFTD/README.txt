Copy all the X-COM: Terror From the Deep subfolders to this directory!

If you can't write to this directory, you can also create a TFTD folder in your
user folder (where your OpenXcom savegames are) and copy your TFTD subfolders
there.

After the copy, this directory should contain at least the following items:
  ANIMS (optional -- not all TFTD versions have this directory)
  FLOP_INT
  GEODATA
  GEOGRAPH
  MAPS
  MISSDAT
  ROUTES
  SOUND
  TERRAIN
