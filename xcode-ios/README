OpenXcom for iOS - Project File

This project file builds OpenXcom and its dependencies to run on iOS-based devices. Be sure to have these dependencies in the proper locations! This project file assumes a directory structure like this:


<base directory>/
  Projects/
    SDL_gfx/
      SDL_gfx.xcodeproj    <-- Xcode project for SDL_gfx
    yaml-cpp/
      yaml-cpp.xcodeproj   <-- Xcode project for yaml-cpp
  Sources/
    OpenXcom/
      xcode-ios/
        OpenXcom.xcodeproj <-- This Xcode project
    SDL/
    SDL_gfx/
    SDL_image/
    SDL_mixer/
    yaml-cpp/


Note that SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer _must_ contain Xcode-iOS folders (with the appropriate Xcode projects).

If unsure, use the https://github.com/sfalexrog/openxcom-ios convenience project.
